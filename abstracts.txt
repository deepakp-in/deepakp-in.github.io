EDBT 2008 | The top-k retrieval problem requires finding k objects most similar to a given query object. Similarities between objects are most often computed as aggregated similarities of their attribute values. We consider the case where the similarities between attribute values are arbitrary (non-metric), due to which standard space partitioning indexes cannot be used. Among the most popular techniques that can handle arbitrary similarity measures is the family of threshold algorithms. These were designed as middleware algorithms that assume that similarity lists for each attribute are available and focus on efficiently merging these lists to arrive at the results. In this paper, we explore multi-dimensional indexing of non-metric spaces that can lead to efficient pruning of the search space utilizing inter-attribute relationships, during top-k computation. We propose an indexing structure, the AL-Tree and an algorithm to do top-k retrieval using it in an online fashion. The ALTree exploits the fact that many real world attributes come from a small value space. We show that our algorithm performs much better than the threshold based algorithms in terms of computational cost due to efficient pruning of the search space. Further, it outperforms them in terms of IOs by upto an order of magnitude in case of dense datasets.
SDM 2008 | Contact centers provide dialog based support to organizations to address various customer related issues. We have observed that the calls received at contact centers mostly follow well defined patterns. Such call flows not only specify how an agent should proceed in a call, handle objections, persuade customers, follow compliance issues, etc but also help to structure the operational process of call handling. Automatically identifying such patterns in terms of distinct segments from a collection of transcripts of conversations would improve productivity of agents as well as track compliance to guidelines. Call transcripts from call centers typically tend to be noisy owing to the noise arising from agent/caller distractions, and errors introduced by the speech recognition engine. Such noise makes classical text segmentation algorithms such as TextTiling, which work on each transcript in isolation, very inappropriate. But such noise effects become statistically insignificant over a corpus of similar calls. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to segment conversational transcripts in an unsupervised way utilizing corpus level information of similar call transcripts. We show that our approach outperforms the classical TextTiling algorithm and also describe ways to improve the segmentation using limited supervision. We discuss various ways of evaluating such an algorithm. We apply the proposed algorithm to a corpus of transcripts of calls from a car reservation call center and evaluate it using various evaluation measures. We apply segmentation to the problem of automatically checking the compliance of agents and show that our segmentation algorithm considerably improves the precision.
EDBT 2009 | A skyline query returns a set of objects that are not dominated by other objects. An object is said to dominate anotherif it is closer to the query than the latter on all factors under consideration. In this paper, we consider the casewhere the similarity measures may be arbitrary and do not necessarily come from a metric space. We first explore middleware algorithms, analyze how skyline retrieval for nonmetric spaces can be done on the middleware backend, andlay down a necessary and sufficient stopping condition for middleware-based skyline algorithms. We develop the Balanced Access Algorithm, which is provably more IO-friendly than the state-of-the-art algorithm for skyline query processing on middleware and show that BAA outperforms thelatter by orders of magnitude. We also show that without prior knowledge about data distributions, it is unlikely to have a middleware algorithm that is more IO-friendly than BAA. In fact, we empirically show that BAA is very close to the absolute lower bound of IO costs for middleware algorithms. Further, we explore the non-middleware setting and devise an online algorithm for skyline retrieval whichuses a recently proposed value space index over non-metric spaces (AL-Tree [10]). The AL-Tree based algorithm is ableto prune subspaces and efficiently maintain candidate setsleading to better performance. We compare our algorithms to existing ones which can work with arbitrary similarity measures and show that our approaches are better in terms of computational and disk access costs leading to significantly better response times.
MDM 2009 | Mobile-enabled social networks applications are becoming increasingly popular. Most of the current social network applications have been designed for high-end mobile devices,and they rely upon features such as GPS, capabilities of the world wide web, and rich media support. However,a significant fraction of mobile user base, especially in the developing world, own low-end devices that are only capable of voice and short text messages (SMS). In this context,a natural question is whether one can design meaningful social network-based applications that can work well withthese simple devices, and if so, what the real challenges are. Towards answering these questions, this paper presents a social network-based recommender system that has beenexplicitly designed to work even with devices that justsupport phone calls and SMS. Our design of the social networkbased recommender system incorporates three featuresthat complement each other to derive highly targeted ads. First, we analyze information such as customerâ€™s addressbooks to estimate the level of social affinity among various users. This social affinity information is used to identify the recommendations to be sent to an individual user. Second, we combine the social affinity information with the spatiotemporal context of users and historical responses of the user to further refine the set of recommendations and to decide when a recommendation would be sent. Third, social affinity computation and spatio-temporal contextual association are continuously tuned through user feedback. We outline the challenges in building such a system, and outline approachesto deal with such challenges.
CIKM 2009 | Clusters of text documents output by clustering algorithms are often hard to interpret. We describe motivating real-world scenarios that necessitate reconfigurability and high interpretability of clusters and outline the problem of generating clusterings with interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. We develop a clustering algorithm toward the outlined goal of building interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models; it works by generating rules with disjunctions and conditions on the frequencies of words, to decide on the membership of a document to a cluster. Each cluster is comprised of precisely the set of documents that satisfy the corresponding rule. We show that our approach outperforms the unsupervised decision tree approach by huge margins. We show that the purity and f-measure losses to achieve interpretability are as little as 5% and 3% respectively using our approach.
COMAD 2009 | Implementing a CRM Analytics solution for a business involves many steps including data extraction, populating the extracted data into a warehouse, and running an appropriate mining algorithm. We propose a CRM Analytics Framework that provides an end-to-end framework for developing and deploying pre-packaged predictive modeling business solutions,intended to help in reducing the time and effort required for building the application. Standardization and metadata-driven development are used in the solution; this makes the framework accessible to non experts. We describe our framework that makes use of industry standard software products and present a case study of its application in the financial domain.
IBM 2009 | Computer server management is an important component of the global IT (information technology) services business. The providers of server management services face unrelenting efficiency challenges in order to remain competitive with other providers. Server system administrators (SAs) represent the majority of the workers in this industry, and their primary task is server management. Since system administration is a highly skilled position, the costs of employing such individuals are high, and thus,the challenge is to increase their efficiency so that a given SA canmanage larger numbers of servers. In this paper, we describe a widely deployed Service Delivery Portal (SDP) in use throughout the Server Systems Operations business of IBM that provides a setof well-integrated technologies to help SAs perform their tasks more efficiently. The SDP is based on three simple design principles: 1) user interface aggregation, 2) data aggregation, and3) knowledge centralization. This paper describes the development of the SDP from the vantage point of these three basic design principles along with lessons learned and the impact assessed from studying the behavior of SAs with and without the tool.
VLDB 2010 | A RkNN query returns all objects whose nearest k neighbors contain the query object. In this paper, we consider RkNN query processing in the case where the distances betweenattribute values are not necessarily metric. Dissimilarities between objects could then be a monotonic aggregate of dissimilarities between their values, such aggregation functions being specified at query time. We outline real world cases that motivate RkNN processing in such scenarios. We consider the AL-Tree index and its applicability in RkNN queryprocessing. We develop an approach that exploits the group level reasoning enabled by the AL-Tree in RkNN processing.We evaluate our approach against a Naive approach that performs sequential scans on contiguous data and an improved block-based approach that we provide. We use real-world datasets and synthetic data with varying characteristics for our experiments. This extensive empirical evaluation shows that our approach is better than existing methods in terms of computational and disk access costs, leading to significantly better response times.
COMAD 2010 | Master data management (MDM) provides a means tolink data from various structured data sources and togenerate a consolidated master record for entities suchas customers or products. However, a large amountof valuable information about entities exists as unstructuredcontent in documents. In this paper, weshow how MDM can be made aware of information from unstructured content by automatically extractingvaluable information from documents. We demonstratefor an example application that it is possibleto make MDM content-aware without compromising MDMâ€™s premise to be the one trusted source for allentity-related information.
EDBT 2011 | A Reverse Skyline query returns all objects whose skyline contains the query object. In this paper, we consider Reverse Skyline query processing where the distance between attribute values are not necessarily metric. We outline real world cases that motivate Reverse Skyline processing in such scenarios. We consider various optimizations to develop ef- ficient algorithms for Reverse Skyline processing. Firstly, we consider block-based processing of objects to optimize on IO costs. We then explore pre-processing to re-arrange objects on disk to speed-up computational and IO costs. We then present our main contribution, which is a method of using group-level reasoning and early pruning to microoptimize processing by reducing attribute level comparisons. An extensive empirical evaluation with real-world datasets and synthetic data of varying characteristics shows that our optimization techniques are indeed very effective in dramatically speeding Reverse Skyline processing, both in terms of computational costs and IO costs.
IAAH 2011 | Archeological Research is often found to be heavy on reasoning prowess and could be significantly aided by data intensive analyses. Excavations provide archeological researchers with material objects and features that serve to to imagine and reconstruct the past. When such hypotheses are put together to draw up the life and times of our ancestors, disagreements between various hypotheses often arise; upon such circumstances, researchers need to go back to the evidences to critically examine and refine their positions. Consider the case of discovery of some remains of a structure that seems to have characteristics of either a ship or a farmhouse. The absence of any evidence of a water body in the premises could be used to weaken the hypothesis that the remains were those of a ship and strengthen the farmhouse assumption. Digitized documentation of the remains could help speed up this such hypothesis framing and decision making. A decision support system to enable and ease such research should hence be able to provide real-time data dicing capabilities and provide insightful analyses of various subsets of data chosen (according the usersâ€™ interests). Coming back to our example, based on the knowledge that pebble like round stones are found close to water bodies, the researcher should be able to query the database to find the number of such artifacts that were found close to the remains in question. If the number of such pebbles (or round stones) are found to be not as abundant as expected close to a water body, the researcher could focus more on the farmhouse hypothesis. In this paper, we focus on our experiences towards building a digital database of archeological findings that would aid such analysis. The assemblage of artifacts which are often too fragmentary and disconnected, demands corroborations and permutation combination analysis which could be achieved through a well conceived digital data base. It can contribute towards scientific sketching of the lost past.
SDM 2011 | Association rule mining is an indispensable tool for discovering insights from large databases and data warehouses. The data in a warehouse being multi-dimensional, it is often useful to mine rules over subsets of data defined by selections over the dimensions. Such interactive rule mining over multi-dimensional query windows is difficult since rule mining is computationally expensive. Current methods using pre-computation of frequent itemsets require counting of some itemsets by revisiting the transaction database at query time, which is very expensive. We develop a method (RMW) that identifies the minimal set of itemsets to compute and store for each cell, so that rule mining over any query window may be performed without going back to the transaction database. We give formal proofs that the set of itemsets chosen by RMW is sufficient to answer any query and also prove that it is the optimal set to be computed for 1 dimensional queries. We demonstrate through an extensive empirical evaluation that RMW achieves extremely fast query response time compared to existing methods, with only moderate overhead in pre-computation and storage.
CIKM 2011 | In this paper, we look into the problem of filtering problem solution repositories (from sources such as community-driven question answering systems) to render them more suitable for usage in knowledge reuse systems. We explore harnessing the fuzzy nature of usability of a solution to a problem, for such compaction. Fuzzy usabilities lead to several challenges; notably, the trade-off between choosing generic or better solutions. We develop an approach that can heed to a user specification of the trade-off between these criteria and introduce several quality measures based on fuzzy usability estimates to ascertain the quality of a problem-solution repository for usage in a Case Based Reasoning system. We establish, through a detailed empirical analysis, that our approach outperforms stateof-the-art approaches on virtually all quality measures.
KAIS 2012 | Clusters of text documents output by clustering algorithms are often hard to interpret. We describe motivating real-world scenarios that necessitate reconfigurability and high interpretability of clusters and outline the problem of generating clusterings with interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. We develop two clustering algorithms toward the outlined goal of building interpretable and reconfigurable cluster models. They generate clusters with associated rules that are composed of conditions on word occurrences or nonoccurrences. The proposed approaches vary in the complexity of the format of the rules; RGC employs disjunctions and conjunctions in rule generation whereas RGC-D rules are simple disjunctions of conditions signifying presence of various words. In both the cases, each cluster is comprised of precisely the set of documents that satisfy the corresponding rule. Rules of the latter kind are easy to interpret, whereas the former leads to more accurate clustering. We show that our approaches outperform the unsupervised decision tree approach for rule-generating clustering and also an approach we provide for generating interpretable models for general clusterings, both by significant margins. We empirically show that the purity and f-measure losses to achieve interpretability can be as little as 3 and 5%, respectively using the algorithms presented herein.
SRII 2012 | Compared to traditional analytics deployment models, cloud-based solutions for business analytics provide numerous advantages such as reduction of a large upfront infrastructural cost and the efforts to setup an in-house analytics team. Such advantages of cloud-based service delivery make it particularly attractive for small and medium businesses. In spite of these advantages, analytics penetration has been low particularly in developing regions such as India and China due to many other factors. In this paper, we propose pre-packaged configurable workflows for analytics as a means of endearing cloud-based analytics to customers, with a special focus on small and medium businesses in developing regions. We introduce the concept of configurable multi-flows that make it easy for non-technical personnel to use and customize without being aware of the technical details of the various operators involved in the workflow. Multi-flows comprise of an overlap of multiple possible workflows and are easily extensible to include more variations to support the evolving needs of customers non-disruptively and incrementally. We detail a case-study of the Retail sector where an extensive survey of retail businesses in India revealed that configurable pre-packaged workflows may indeed help improve market penetration. We then identify common analytics needs of retail customers, and detail how such tasks can be expressed as configurable multi-flows. Further, we describe a fully functional implementation of our system that supports configurable multi-flows for analytics. Finally, we illustrate the ease-of-use of configurable multi-flows with the use of multiple screenshots. 
SIGIR 2012 | Online forums are becoming a popular way of finding useful information on the web. Search over forums for existing discussion threads so far is limited to keyword-based search due to the minimal effort required on part of the users. However, it is often not possible to capture all the relevant context in a complex query using a small number of keywords. Examplebased search that retrieves similar discussion threads given one exemplary thread is an alternate approach that can help the user provide richer context and vastly improve forum search results. In this paper, we address the problem of finding similar threads to a given thread. Towards this, we propose a novel methodology to estimate similarity between discussion threads. Our method exploits the thread structure to decompose threads in to set of weighted overlapping components. It then estimates pairwise thread similarities by quantifying how well the information in the threads are mutually contained within each other using lexical similarities between their underlying components. We compare our proposed methods on real datasets against state-of-the-art thread retrieval mechanisms wherein we illustrate that our techniques outperform others by large margins on popular retrieval evaluation measures such as NDCG, MAP, Precision@k and MRR. In particular, consistent improvements of up to 10% are observed on all evaluation measures.
WAIM 2012 | When a user of a microblogging site authors a microblog post or browses through a microblog post, it provides cues as to what topic she is interested in at that point in time. Example-based search that retrieves similar tweets given one exemplary tweet, such as the one just authored, can help provide the user with relevant content. We investigate various components of microblog posts, such as the associated timestamp, authorâ€™s social network, and the content of the post, and develop approaches that harness such factors in finding relevant tweets given a query tweet. An empirical analysis of such techniques on real world twitter-data is then presented to quantify the utility of the various factors in assessing tweet relevance. We observe that content-wise similar tweets that also contain extra information not already present in the query, are perceived as useful. We then develop a composite technique that combines the various approaches by scoring tweets using a dynamic query-specific linear combination of separate techniques. An empirical evaluation establishes the effectiveness of the composite technique, and that it outperforms each of its constituents
VLDB 2012 | Master data management (MDM) integrates data from multiple structured data sources and builds a consolidated 360- degree view of business entities such as customers and products. Todayâ€™s MDM systems are not prepared to integrate information from unstructured data sources, such as news reports, emails, call-center transcripts, and chat logs. However, those unstructured data sources may contain valuable information about the same entities known to MDM from the structured data sources. Integrating information from unstructured data into MDM is challenging as textual references to existing MDM entities are often incomplete and imprecise and the additional entity information extracted from text should not impact the trustworthiness of MDM data. In this paper, we present an architecture for making MDM text-aware and showcase its implementation as IBM InfoSphere MDM Extension for Unstructured Text Correlation, an add-on to IBM InfoSphere Master Data Management Standard Edition. We highlight how MDM benefits from additional evidence found in documents when doing entity resolution and relationship discovery. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of integrating information from unstructured data sources into MDM.
CIKM 2012 | We consider the problem of segmenting text documents that have a two-part structure such as a problem part and a solution part. Documents of this genre include incident reports that typically involve description of events relating to a problem followed by those pertaining to the solution that was tried. Segmenting such documents into the component two parts would render them usable in knowledge reuse frameworks such as Case-Based Reasoning. This segmentation problem presents a hard case for traditional text segmentation due to the lexical inter-relatedness of the segments. We develop a two-part segmentation technique that can harness a corpus of similar documents to model the behavior of the two segments and their inter-relatedness using language models and translation models respectively. In particular, we use separate language models for the problem and solution segment types, whereas the interrelatedness between segment types is modeled using an IBM Model 1 translation model. We model documents as being generated starting from the problem part that comprises of words sampled from the problem language model, followed by the solution part whose words are sampled either from the solution language model or from a translation model conditioned on the words already chosen in the problem part. We show, through an extensive set of experiments on real-world data, that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art text segmentation algorithms in the accuracy of segmentation, and that such improved accuracy translates well to improved usability in Case-based Reasoning systems. We also analyze the robustness of our technique to varying amounts and types of noise and empirically illustrate that our technique is quite noise tolerant, and degrades gracefully with increasing amounts of noise.
WISE 2012 | Learning or writing regular expressions to identify instances of a specific concept within text documents with a high precision and recall is challenging. It is relatively easy to improve the precision of an initial regular expression by identifying false positives covered and tweaking the expression to avoid the false positives. However, modifying the expression to improve recall is difficult since false negatives can only be identified by manually analyzing all documents, in the absence of any tools to identify the missing instances. We focus on partially automating the discovery of missing instances by soliciting minimal user feedback. We present a technique to identify good generalizations of a regular expression that have improved recall while retaining high precision. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique as compared to existing methods and show results for a variety of tasks such as identification of dates, phone numbers, product names, and course numbers on real world datasets.
ECIR 2013 | Textual problem-solution repositories are available today in various forms, most commonly as problem-solution pairs from community question answering systems. Modern search engines that operate on the web can suggest possible completions in real-time for users as they type in queries. We study the problem of generating intelligent query suggestions for users of customized search systems that enable querying over problem-solution repositories. Due to the small scale and specialized nature of such systems, we often do not have the luxury of depending on query logs for finding query suggestions. We propose a retrieval model for generating query suggestions for search on a set of problem solution pairs. We harness the problem solution partition inherent in such repositories to improve upon traditional query suggestion mechanisms designed for systems that search over general textual corpora. We evaluate our technique over real problem-solution datasets and illustrate that our technique provides large and statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art technique in query suggestion.
ACL 2014 | Discussion forums have evolved into a dependable source of knowledge to solve common problems. However, only a minority of the posts in discussion forums are solution posts. Identifying solution posts from discussion forums, hence, is an important research problem. In this paper, we present a technique for unsupervised solution post identification leveraging a so far unexplored textual feature, that of lexical correlations between problems and solutions. We use translation models and language models to exploit lexical correlations and solution post character respectively. Our technique is designed to not rely much on structural features such as post metadata since such features are often not uniformly available across forums. Our clustering-based iterative solution identification approach based on the EM-formulation performs favorably in an empirical evaluation, beating the only unsupervised solution identification technique from literature by a very large margin. We also show that our unsupervised technique is competitive against methods that require supervision, outperforming one such technique comfortably
SEM 2014 | Research in emotion analysis of text suggest that emotion lexicon based features are superior to corpus based n-gram features. However the static nature of the general purpose emotion lexicons make them less suited to social media analysis, where the need to adopt to changes in vocabulary usage and context is crucial. In this paper we propose a set of methods to extract a word-emotion lexicon automatically from an emotion labelled corpus of tweets. Our results confirm that the features derived from these lexicons outperform the standard Bag-of-words features when applied to an emotion classification task. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with both manually crafted lexicons and a state-of-the-art lexicon generated using Point-Wise Mutual Information, show that the lexicons generated from the proposed methods lead to significantly better classi- fication performance.
EDBT 2014 | We address the problem of mining interesting phrases from subsets of a text corpus where the subset is specified using a set of features such as keywords that form a query. Previous algorithms for the problem have proposed solutions that involve sifting through a phrase dictionary based index or a document-based index where the solution is linear in either the phrase dictionary size or the size of the document subset. We propose the usage of an independence assumption between query keywords given the top correlated phrases, wherein the pre-processing could be reduced to discovering phrases from among the top phrases per each feature in the query. We then outline an indexing mechanism where per-keyword phrase lists are stored either in disk or memory, so that popular aggregation algorithms such as No Random Access and Sort-merge Join may be adapted to do the scoring at real-time to identify the top interesting phrases. Though such an approach is expected to be approximate, we empirically illustrate that very high accuracies (of over 90%) are achieved against the results of exact algorithms. Due to the simplified list-aggregation, we are also able to provide response times that are orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art algorithms. Interestingly, our disk-based approach outperforms the in-memory baselines by up to hundred times and sometimes more, confirming the superiority of the proposed method.
PKDD 2014 | The last decade has witnessed an unprecedented growth in availability of data having spatio-temporal characteristics. Given the scale and richness of such data, finding spatio-temporal patterns that demonstrate signifi- cantly different behavior from their neighbors could be of interest for various application scenarios such as â€“ weather modeling, analyzing spread of disease outbreaks, monitoring traffic congestions, and so on. In this paper, we propose an automated approach of exploring and discovering such anomalous patterns irrespective of the underlying domain from which the data is recovered. Our approach differs significantly from traditional methods of spatial outlier detection, and employs two phases â€“ i) discovering homogeneous regions, and ii) evaluating these regions as anomalies based on their statistical difference from a generalized neighborhood. We evaluate the quality of our approach and distinguish it from existing techniques via an extensive experimental evaluation.
ICDE 2015 | Quantifying the similarity between two trajectories is a fundamental operation in analysis of spatio-temporal databases. While a number of distance functions exist, the recent shift in the dynamics of the trajectory generation procedure violates one of their core assumptions; a consistent and uniform sampling rate. In this paper, we formulate a robust distance function called Edit Distance with Projections (EDwP) to match trajectories under inconsistent and variable sampling rates through dynamic interpolation. This is achieved by deploying the idea of projections, which goes beyond matching only the sampled points while aligning trajectories. To enable efficient trajectory retrievals using EDwP, we design an index structure called TrajTree. TrajTree derives its pruning power by employing the unique combination of bounding boxes with Lipschitz embedding. Extensive experiments on real trajectory databases demonstrate EDwP to be up to 5 times more accurate than the state-of-the-art distance functions. Additionally, TrajTree increases the efficiency of trajectory retrievals by up to an order of magnitude over existing techniques.
WWW 2015 | Predicting the next location of a user based on their previous visiting pattern is one of the primary tasks over data from location based social networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare. Many different aspects of these so-called \check-in" profiles of a user have been made use of in this task, including spatial and temporal information of check-ins as well as the social network information of the user. Building more sophisticated prediction models by enriching these check-in data by combining them with information from other sources is challenging due to the limited data that these LBSNs expose due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a framework to use the location data from LBSNs, combine it with the data from maps for associating a set of venue categories with these locations. For example, if the user is found to be checking in at a mall that has cafes, cinemas and restaurants according to the map, all these information is associated. This category information is then leveraged to predict the next checkin location by the user. Our experiments with publicly available check-in dataset show that this approach improves on the state-of-the-art methods for location prediction.
Springer 2015 | This book provides a comprehensive tutorial on similarity operators. The authors systematically survey the set of similarity operators, primarily focusing on their semantics, while also touching upon mechanisms for processing them effectively. The book starts off by providing introductory material on similarity search systems, highlighting the central role of similarity operators in such systems. This is followed by a systematic categorized overview of the variety of similarity operators that have been proposed in literature over the last two decades, including advanced operators such as RkNN, Reverse k-Ranks, Skyline k-Groups and K-N-Match. Since indexing is a core technology in the practical implementation of similarity operators, various indexing mechanisms are summarized. Finally, current research challenges are outlined, so as to enable interested readers to identify potential directions for future investigations. In summary, this book offers a comprehensive overview of the field of similarity search operators, allowing readers to understand the area of similarity operators as it stands today, and in addition providing them with the background needed to understand recent novel approaches.
Springer 2016 | The problem of detecting spatially-coherent groups of data that exhibit anomalous behavior has started to attract attention due to applications across areas such as epidemic analysis and weather forecasting. Earlier efforts from the data mining community have largely focused on finding outliers, individual data objects that display deviant behavior. Such point-based methods are not easy to extend to find groups of data that exhibit anomalous behavior. Scan statistics are methods from the statistics community that have considered the problem of identifying regions where data objects exhibit a behavior that is atypical of the general dataset. The spatial scan statistic and methods that build upon it mostly adopt the framework of defining a character for regions (e.g., circular or elliptical) of objects and repeatedly sampling regions of such character followed by applying a statistical test for anomaly detection. In the past decade, there have been efforts from the statistics community to enhance efficiency of scan statistics as well as to enable discovery of arbitrarily shaped anomalous regions. On the other hand, the data mining community has started to look at determining anomalous regions that have behavior divergent from their neighborhood. In this chapter, we survey the space of techniques for detecting anomalous regions on spatial data from across the data mining and statistics communities while outlining connections to well-studied problems in clustering and image segmentation. We analyze the techniques systematically by categorizing them appropriately to provide a structured birds-eye view of the work on anomalous region detection; we hope that this would encourage better cross-pollination of ideas across communities to help advance the frontier in anomaly detection.
ECAI 2016 | With Tweet volumes reaching 500 million a day, sampling is inevitable for any application using Twitter data. Realizing this, data providers such as Twitter, Gnip and Boardreader license sampled data streams priced in accordance with the sample size. Big Data applications working with sampled data would be interested in working with a large enough sample that is representative of the universal dataset. Previous work focusing on the representativeness issue has considered ensuring that global occurrence rates of key terms, be reliably estimated from the sample. Present technology allows sample size estimation in accordance with probabilistic bounds on occurrence rates for the case of uniform random sampling. In this paper, we consider the problem of further improving sample size estimates by leveraging stratification in Twitter data. We analyze our estimates through an extensive study using simulations and real-world data, establishing the superiority of our method over uniform random sampling. Our work provides the technical knowhow for data providers to expand their portfolio to include stratified sampled datasets, whereas applications are benefited by being able to monitor more topics/events at the same data and computing cost.
WISE 2016 | A search query, being a very concise grounding of user intent, could potentially have many possible interpretations. Search engines hedge their bets by diversifying top results to cover multiple such possibilities so that the user is likely to be satisfied, whatever be her intended interpretation. Diversified Query Expansion is the problem of diversifying query expansion suggestions, so that the user can specialize the query to better suit her intent, even before perusing search results. We propose a method, Select-Link-Rank, that exploits semantic information from Wikipedia to generate diversified query expansions. SLR does collective processing of terms and Wikipedia entities in an integrated framework, simultaneously diversifying query expansions and entity recommendations. SLR starts with selecting informative terms from search results of the initial query, links them to Wikipedia entities, performs a diversity-conscious entity scoring and transfers such scoring to the term space to arrive at query expansion suggestions. Through an extensive empirical analysis and user study, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art diversified query expansion and diversified entity recommendation techniques. 
EMNLP 2016 | Community-driven Question Answering (CQA) systems that crowdsource experiential information in the form of questions and answers and have accumulated valuable reusable knowledge. Clustering of QA datasets from CQA systems provides a means of organizing the content to ease tasks such as manual curation and tagging. In this paper, we present a clustering method that exploits the two-part question-answer structure in QA datasets to improve clustering quality. Our method, MixKMeans, composes question and answer space similarities in a way that the space on which the match is higher is allowed to dominate. This construction is motivated by our observation that semantic similarity between question-answer data (QAs) could get localized in either space. We empirically evaluate our method on a variety of real-world labeled datasets. Our results indicate that our method significantly outperforms stateof- the-art clustering methods for the task of clustering question-answer archives.
IJCAI 2017 | Location-based social networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare offer a platform for users to share and be aware of each otherâ€™s physical movements. As a result of such a sharing of check-in information with each other, users can be influenced to visit at the locations visited by their friends. Quantifying such influences in these LBSNs is useful in various settings such as location promotion, personalized recommendations, mobility pattern prediction etc. In this paper, we focus on the problem of location promotion and develop a model to quantify the influence specific to a location between a pair of users. Specifically, we develop a joint model called LoCaTe, consisting of (i) user mobility model estimated using kernel density estimates; (ii) a model of the semantics of the location using topic models; and (iii) a model of time-gap between checkins using exponential distribution. We validate our model on a long-term crawl of Foursquare data collected between Jan 2015 â€“ Feb 2016, as well as on publicly available LBSN datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that LoCaTe significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models for the same task.
EMNLP 2017 | Community-driven Question Answering (CQA) systems such as Yahoo! Answers have become valuable sources of reusable information. CQA retrieval enables usage of historical CQA archives to solve new questions posed by users. This task has received much recent attention, with methods building upon literature from translation models, topic models, and deep learning. In this paper, we devise a CQA retrieval technique, LASER-QA, that embeds question-answer pairs within a unified latent space preserving the local neighborhood structure of question and answer spaces. The idea is that such a space mirrors semantic similarity among questions as well as answers, thereby enabling high quality retrieval. Through an empirical analysis on various real-world QA datasets, we illustrate the improved effectiveness of LASER-QA over state-of-theart methods.
ICON 2017 | Differentiating intrinsic language words from transliterable words is a key step aiding text processing tasks involving different natural languages. We consider the problem of unsupervised separation of transliterable words from native words for text in Malayalam language. Outlining a key observation on the diversity of characters beyond the word stem, we develop an optimization method to score words based on their nativeness. Our method relies on the usage of probability distributions over character n-grams that are refined in step with the nativeness scorings in an iterative optimization formulation. Using an empirical evaluation, we illustrate that our method, DTIM, provides significant improvements in nativeness scoring for Malayalam, establishing DTIM as the preferred method for the task.
WWWJ 2018 | A search query, being a very concise grounding of user intent, could potentially have many possible interpretations. Search engines hedge their bets by diversifying top results to cover multiple such possibilities so that the user is likely to be satisfied, whatever be her intended interpretation. Diversified Query Expansion is the problem of diversifying query expansion suggestions, so that the user can specialize the query to better suit her intent, even before perusing search results. In this paper, we consider the usage of semantic resources and tools to arrive at improved methods for diversified query expansion. In particular, we develop two methods, those that leverage Wikipedia and pre-learnt distributional word embeddings respectively. Both the approaches operate on a common three-phase framework; that of first taking a set of informative terms from the search results of the initial query, then building a graph, following by using a diversity-conscious node ranking to prioritize candidate terms for diversified query expansion. Our methods differ in the second phase, with the first method Select-Link-Rank (SLR) linking terms with Wikipedia entities to accomplish graph construction; on the other hand, our second method, Select-Embed-Rank (SER), constructs the graph using similarities between distributional word
embeddings. Through an empirical analysis and user study, we show that SLR ourperforms state-of-the-art diversified query expansion methods, thus establishing that Wikipedia is an effective resource to aid diversified query expansion. Our empirical analysis also illustrates that SER outperforms the baselines convincingly, asserting that it is the best available method for those cases where SLR is not applicable; these include narrow-focus search systems where a relevant knowledge base is unavailable. Our SLR method is also seen to outperform a state-of-the-art method in the task of diversified entity ranking.
PAKDD 2018 | Record linkage (RL) is a process of identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity. Many existing approaches to RL apply supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to generate a classification model that classifies a pair of records as either linked or non-linked. In such techniques, the labeled data helps guide the choice and relative importance to similarity measures to be employed in RL. Unsupervised RL is therefore a more challenging problem since the quality of similarity measures needs to be estimated in the absence of linkage labels. In this paper we propose a novel optimization approach to unsupervised RL. We define a scoring technique which aggregates similarities between two records along all attributes and all available similarity measures using a weighted sum formulation. The core idea behind our method is embodied in an objective function representing the overall ambiguity of the scoring across a dataset. Our goal is to iteratively optimize the objective function to progressively refine estimates of the scoring weights in the direction of lesser overall ambiguity. We have evaluated our approach on multiple real world datasets which are commonly used in the RL community. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, while being orders of magnitude faster.
AAAI 2018 | Regular expressions are an important building block of rule-based information extraction systems. Regexes can encode rules to recognize instances of simple entities which can then feed into the identification of more complex cross-entity relationships. Manually crafting a regex that recognizes all possible instances of an entity is difficult since an entity can manifest in a variety of different forms. Thus, the problem of automatically generalizing manually crafted seed regexes to improve the recall of IE systems has attracted research attention. In this paper, we propose a bootstrapped approach to improve the recall for extraction of regex-formatted entities, with the only source of supervision being the seed regex. Our approach starts from a manually authored high precision seed regex for the entity of interest, and uses the matches of the seed regex and the context around these matches to identify more instances of the entity. These are then used to identify a set of diverse, high recall regexes that are representative of this entity. Through an empirical evaluation over multiple real world document corpora, we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.
DEXA 2018 | Large-scale demographic datasets with spatial information provide a rich platform for human development research. Much emphasis is often placed on understanding deviations from dataset-level behavior across demographic attributes within spatially coherent regions, since those could point to a local condition worth addressing through regional policies, or at the other extreme, a less known success story that offers new learnings. Inspired by such scenarios, we build upon domain knowledge from HDR to devise an interestingness scoring for spatial regions and formulate the computational task of interesting spatial region identification. Accordingly, we develop a taxonomic organization of spatial regions and formulate bounds on interestingness scores, which are then leveraged to develop an efficient technique to address the task. Our search method is empirically evaluated over two real-world datasets, and is seen to record orders of magnitude of response time improvements over region enumeration. The absolute response times and the memory overheads of our approach are seen to be within highly desirable ranges, establishing the effectiveness of our solution for the task.
Springer 2019 | With a plethora of data capturing modalities becoming available, the same data object often leaves different kinds of digital footprints. This naturally leads to datasets comprising the same set of data objects represented in different forms, called multi-view data. Among the most fundamental tasks in unsupervised learning is that of clustering, the task of grouping data objects into groups of related objects. Multi-view clustering (MVC) is a flourishing field in unsupervised learning; the MVC task considers leveraging multiple views of data objects in order to arrive
at a more effective and accurate grouping than what can be achieved by just using one view of data. Multi-view clustering methods differ in the kind of modelling they use in order to fuse multiple-views, by managing the synergies, complimentarities and conflicts across data views, and arriving at a single clustering output across the multiple views in the dataset. This chapter provides a survey of a sample of multi-view clustering methods, with an emphasis on bringing out the wide diversity in solution formulations that have been considered. We pay specific attention to enable the reader understand the intuition behind each method ahead of describing the technical details of the method, to ensure that the survey is accessible to readers who may not be machine learning specialists. We also outline some popular datasets that have been used to empirically evaluate MVC methods.
TIST 2019 | Location-based social networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare offer a platform for users to share and be aware of each otherâ€™s physical movements. As a result of such a sharing of check-in information with each other, users can be influenced to visit (or check-in) at the locations visited by their friends. Quantifying such influences in these LBSNs is useful in various settings such as location promotion, personalized recommendations, mobility pattern prediction etc. In this paper, we develop a model to quantify the influence specific to a location between a pair of users. Specifically, we develop a framework called LoCaTe, that combines (a) a user mobility model based on kernel density estimates; (b) a model of the semantics of the location using topic models; and (c) a user correlation model that uses an exponential distribution. We further develop LoCaTe+, an advanced model within the same framework where user correlation is quantified using a Mutually Exciting Hawkes Process. We show the applicability of LoCaTe and LoCaTe+ for location promotion and location recommendation tasks using LBSNs. Our models are validated using a long-term crawl of Foursquare data collected between Jan 2015 - Feb 2016, as well as other publicly available LBSN datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the LoCaTe framework in capturing location-specific influence between users. We also show that our models improve over state-of-the-art models for the task of location promotion as well as location recommendation.
TimeSeriesWorkshop 2019 | Time series are ubiquitous in real world problems and computing distance between two time series is often required in several learning tasks. Computing similarity between time series by ignoring variations in speed or warping is often encountered and dynamic time warping (DTW) is the state of the art. However DTW is not applicable in algorithms which require kernel or vectors. In this paper, we propose a mechanism named WaRTEm to generate vector embeddings of time series such that distance measures in the embedding space exhibit resilience to warping. Therefore, WaRTEm is more widely applicable than DTW. WaRTEm is based on a twin auto-encoder architecture and a training strategy involving warping operators for generating warping resilient embeddings for time series datasets. We evaluate the performance of WaRTEm and observed more than 20% improvement over DTW in multiple real-world datasets.
AAAI 2020 | We consider the task of learning distributed representations for arithmetic word problems. We outline the characteristics of the domain of arithmetic word problems that make generic text embedding methods inadequate, necessitating a specialized representation learning method to facilitate the task of retrieval across a wide range of use cases within online learning platforms. Our contribution is two-fold; first, we propose several â€™operatorsâ€™ that distil knowledge of the domain of arithmetic word problems and schemas into word problem transformations. Second, we propose a novel neural architecture that combines LSTMs with graph convolutional networks to leverage word problems and their operator-transformed versions to learn distributed representations for word problems. While our target is to ensure that the distributed representations are schema-aligned, we do not make use of schema labels in the learning process, thus yielding an unsupervised representation learning method. Through an evaluation on retrieval over a publicly available corpus of word problems, we illustrate that our framework is able to consistently improve upon contemporary generic text embeddings in terms of schema-alignment.
EDBT 2020 | A clustering may be considered as fair on pre-specified sensitive attributes if the proportions of sensitive attribute groups in each cluster reflect that in the dataset. In this paper, we consider the task of fair clustering for scenarios involving multiple multi-valued or numeric sensitive attributes. We propose a fair clustering method, FairKM (Fair K-Means), that is inspired by the popular K-Means clustering formulation. We outline a computational notion of fairness which is used along with a cluster coherence objective, to yield the FairKM clustering method. We empirically evaluate our approach, wherein we quantify both the quality and fairness of clusters, over real-world datasets. Our experimental evaluation illustrates that the clusters generated by FairKM fare significantly better on both clustering quality and fair representation of sensitive attribute groups compared to the clusters from a state-of-the-art baseline fair clustering method.
